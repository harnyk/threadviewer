# Task: Improve formatting of thread messages



Formatting of thread messages should be displayed like a normal dialogue, with roles for assistant and user.

It should be human readable and not just a dump of Go objects.

# Solution

Go to main/main.go and fix the formatting.
Dump the entire file with all changes.
Compile to see if it works.
